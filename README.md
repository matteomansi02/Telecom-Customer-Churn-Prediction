# Customer Churn Prediction
Churn, also known as customer attrition, refers to the phenomenon of customers discontinuing their relationship with a company or service provider. It is a prevalent challenge faced by businesses across multiple sectors, such as telecommunications, finance and e-commerce.

The telecommunication industry, offering mostly subscription-based services, has a monthly churn rate of 2%, and considering that the cost of acquiring a new customer can be as much as 25 times as the cost of keeping them, it has become a prevalent problem.

Churn prediction models empower businesses to identify customers who are likely to leave and take proactive measures to prevent attrition. By anticipating churn, companies can develop personalized retention strategies, offer tailored incentives, improve customer satisfaction, and enhance overall customer experience.

In this notebook I make use of IBM Sample Data Set. The latest version of the dataset is available on the IBM Community website [IBM Community Website](https://community.ibm.com/community/user/businessanalytics/blogs/steven-macko/2019/07/11/telco-customer-churn-1113).

The task is a supervised learning problem of predicting whether a customer will churn or not.
